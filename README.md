**GIT**

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to collaborate on a project by tracking changes to files. It is widely used in software development to manage source code.

Here are some fundamental Git commands:

1. `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

2. `git clone <repository>`: Creates a local copy of a remote repository on your machine.

3. `git add <file>`: Adds a file to the staging area, preparing it for commit.

4. `git commit -m "<message>"`: Commits the changes in the staging area to the repository, along with a descriptive message.

5. `git status`: Displays the status of the working directory and the staging area, showing which files are modified, staged, or untracked.

6. `git pull`: Fetches the latest changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

7. `git push`: Pushes your local commits to a remote repository, updating it with your changes.

8. `git branch`: Lists all the branches in the repository.

9. `git checkout <branch>`: Switches to a different branch.

10. `git merge <branch>`: Merges the specified branch into the current branch.

11. `git diff`: Shows the differences between the working directory and the staging area.

12. `git log`: Displays a log of all commits in the repository, showing commit hashes, authors, dates, and commit messages.
